# Progressive Ansible

These exercises are meant to show how to use Ansible in a progressive way.
Starting with simple concepts.
Slowly building upon those concepts along the way.

In each exercise, you will find an overview
of what that lesson is trying to teach.

In their current form, they don't provide detailed instruction --
that is left up to the instructor.
Think of these more as instructor's notes than student material,
but of course they could be used as reference.
